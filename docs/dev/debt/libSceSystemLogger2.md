# libSceSystemLogger2 technical debt

### Unknown function info

- [sceSystemLogger2GetTimestamp, sceSystemLogger2Initialize, sceSystemLogger2SetEventAsync, sceSystemLogger2SetEventAsyncEx and sceSystemLogger2Terminate](../../../core/libs/prx/libSceSystemLogger2/Export.cpp) (libSceSystemLogger2) - names and NIDs are present in the [PS5 3.20 export inventory](https://github.com/DNNDHH/PS5-3.20_Libs/blob/b2a77c09cd71c01f34c790cfbe98c751a13262ad/libSceSystemLogger2.c), but no credible prototypes were found. The declarations have no parameters solely to resolve known imports; this is not an ABI claim and callers must not call them until signatures are verified

### Additional callable exports

- [Additional callable exports](../../../core/libs/prx/libSceSystemLogger2/Export.cpp) - 3 entries observed in the 3.20 export inventory and present in the later 13.60-labelled inventory are import-resolution declarations only. The later inventory label does not authenticate a retail firmware version. Parameter lists, return types and behavior are unverified; parameterless `int` declarations are placeholders, not verified ABI contracts. Every entry throws through `NotImplemented_nid_no_patch`. Unidentified names use literal NID aliases. No runtime functionality is implemented. Identified candidate names match their NIDs in the [public symbol database](https://github.com/zecoxao/sce_symbols/blob/2883963a0a514ba6e77407a08ef4730a65e88254/aerolib.csv) or [supplemental catalog](https://github.com/claimore22/ps5rs/blob/2304be5131221bae0dac24b9767cabffda33f747/data/nids.csv).
